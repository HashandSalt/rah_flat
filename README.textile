h1. rah_flat

p. A plugin for "Textpattern CMS":http://www.textpattern.com. Edit data in database tables (forms, pages) as flat files.

p. Configuration and mapping database contents as flat files is done using "XML configuration files":https://github.com/gocom/rah_flat/blob/master/config/rah_flat.config.xml. Using these configuration mappings, every database table can be turned into flat files, as long as the database table has a primary column. The configuration files basically tell the application where to look for content and how to identify the files.
